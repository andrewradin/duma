      "text": "PCT/US93/07242 I claim: An orally-ingestible pharmaceutical composition for the effective oral treatment or prevention of irritable bowel syndrome, including diarrhea, constipation, and pain aspects thereof, in a human patient, consisting essentially of a dry powdered admixture of an amount of an anionbinding polymer and a hydrophilic polymer, or a polymer which is both an anion-binding polymer and a hydrophilic polymer, optionally together with a pharmaceuticallyacceptable diluent or carrier, which can conveniently be admixed with and suspended in a minor amount of fluid just prior to oral ingestion, which is effective for such purpose. The pharmaceutical composition of Claim 1, wherein the weight ratio of the anion-binding polymer to the hydrophilic polymer is between about 2:1 and about 1:2. The pharmaceutical composition of Claim 1, wherein the total amount of all polymers per dose of the composition is adapted to be between about 1g and 24g. The pharmaceutical composition of Claim 1, wherein the weight ratio of the anion-binding polymer to the hydrophilic polymer is between about 2:1 and about 1:2 and wherein 18 PCT/US93/07242 the total amount of all polymers per dose of the composition is adapted to be between about 1g and about 24g. The pharmaceutical composition of Claim 4, wherein the anion-binding polymer is cholesstyramine, a colestipol pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salt, MCI-196, or diethylaminoethyl dextran, and the hydrophilic polymer is selected from the group consisting of pectin, guar gum, psyllium hydrophilic colloid, locust bean gum, alginic acid, cellulose gum, carrageenan, oat bran beta-glucan, xanthan gum, methylcellulose, and polycarbophil. The pharmaceutical composition of Claim 4, wherein the anion-binding polymer is cholestyramine or a colestipol salt and wherein the hydrophilic polymer is pectin. The pharmaceutical composition of Claim 1, wherein the polymer employed is bath an anion-binding polymer and a hydrophilic polymer. The pharmaceutical composition of Claim 7, wherein the polymer is chitosan. A method of treating or preventing irritable bowel syndrome, including diarrhea, constipation, and pain aspects thereof, in a human patient, consisting essentially of the step of orally administering to the said human patient an amount of an anion-binding polymer and a hydrophilic polymer, either simultaneously, concurrently, or in the form of a pharmaceutical composition consisting essentially of the anion-binding polymer and the hydrophilic polymer, or consisting essentially of a polymer which is both an anion-binding polymer and a hydrophilic polymer, 19 PCT/US93/07242 which is effective for alleviation or prevention of the said irritable bowel syndrome, preferably wherein the weight ratio of the anion-binding polymer to the hydrophilic polymer is between about 2:1 and about 1:2, especially wherein the total amount of all polymers per dose is between about 1g and 24g, preferably wherein the weight ratio of the anion-binding polymer to the hydrophilic polymer is between about 2:1 and about 1:2 and wherein the total amount of all polymers per dose is between about 1g and about 24g, preferably wherein the anion-binding polymer is cholestyramine, a colestipol pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salt, MCI-196, or diethylaminoethyl dextran, and the hydrophilic polymer is selected from the group consisting of pectin, guar gum, psyllium hydrophilic colloid, locust bean gum, alginic acid, cellulose gum, carrageenan, oat bran beta-glucan, xanthan gum, methylcellulose, and polycarbophil, or wherein the anion-binding and hydrophilic characteristics are combined in a single polymer, especially wherein the polymer is chitosan, and preferably wherein the anion-binding polymer is cholestyramine or a colestipol salt and wherein the hydrophilic polymer is pectin. Use of a dry powdered admixture of a polymer or polymers, optionally together with a pharmaceuticallyacceptable diluent or carrier, as defined in Claim 9, for the preparation of an orally-ingestible pharmaceutical composition useful for the effective oral treatment or prevention of irritable bowel syndrome.",
