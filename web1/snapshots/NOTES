This directory holds RefreshGroup files built on dev07 for purposes of
evaluating system changes. This file holds notes about the individual
snapshots.

Snapshots are created by running:
./scripts/multi_refresh.py --result-json-file <snapshot_file> <user> 1 4 26 53 55 73 92 99 123

Each time a new production database backup is loaded, all previous snapshots
are lost, so this should be kept to a minimum. The first test batch was
build from backup 2018.11.23.08.30.sql.gz. Several patches were applied to
this database:
	- ws 55 and 92 were cleared of unused chembl drugs, and drugbank and
	  chembl.adme drugs were topped up
	- ws 123 had its dgn disease name blanked out
	- ws 92 had its dgn disease name set to C0699791
	- ws 55 had its dgn disease name set to C0887833
	- ws 123 had a XXX_dry_AMD disease name added (nonexudative
	  age-related macular degeneration)

2018-11-29_02-46-24.json - initial snapshot; this required multiple code and
	db changes, and manual restarts, before it completed. It is recorded as
	a test baseline; the next file should run cleanly from start to finish.
2018-11-29_03-07-21.json - fresh re-run from the beginning against all the
	patches above (i.e. patches were in place for all runs in the snapshot,
	not just the later ones)
