DI-03474	definition	A form of acrofacial dysostosis, a group of disorders which are characterized by malformation of the craniofacial skeleton and the limbs. The major facial features of AFD1 include downslanted palpebral fissures, midface retrusion, and micrognathia, the latter of which often requires the placement of a tracheostomy in early childhood. Limb defects typically involve the anterior (radial) elements of the upper limbs and manifest as small or absent thumbs, triphalangeal thumbs, radial hyoplasia or aplasia, and radioulnar synostosis. Phocomelia of the upper limbs and, occasionally, lower-limb defects have also been reported.

DI-00030	definition	A localized disorder of keratinization, which is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Its onset is early in life with multiple flat-topped, flesh-colored papules on the hands and feet, punctate keratoses on the palms and soles, with varying degrees of nail involvement. The histopathology shows a distinctive pattern of epidermal features with hyperkeratosis, hypergranulosis and acanthosis together with papillomatosis. These changes are frequently associated with circumscribed elevations of the epidermis that are said to resemble church spires. There are no features of dyskeratosis or acantholysis, the typical findings in lesions of Darier disease.

DI-01181	canonical	Alpha-thalassemia.
DI-01181	definition	A form of thalassemia. Thalassemias are common monogenic diseases occurring mostly in Mediterranean and Southeast Asian populations. The hallmark of alpha-thalassemia is an imbalance in globin-chain production in the adult HbA molecule. The level of alpha chain production can range from none to very nearly normal levels. Deletion of both copies of each of the two alpha-globin genes causes alpha(0)- thalassemia, also known as homozygous alpha thalassemia. Due to the complete absence of alpha chains, the predominant fetal hemoglobin is a tetramer of gamma-chains (Bart hemoglobin) that has essentially no oxygen carrying capacity. This causes oxygen starvation in the fetal tissues leading to prenatal lethality or early neonatal death. The loss of two alpha genes results in mild alpha-thalassemia, also known as heterozygous alpha-thalassemia. Affected individuals have small red cells and a mild anemia (microcytosis). If three of the four alpha- globin genes are functional, individuals are completely asymptomatic. Some rare forms of alpha-thalassemia are due to point mutations (non- deletional alpha-thalassemia).

DI-02714	canonical	Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins.
DI-02714	definition	A rare developmental disorder characterized by abnormal development of the capillary vascular system in the lungs. Histological features include failure of formation and ingrowth of alveolar capillaries, medial muscular thickening of small pulmonary arterioles with muscularization of the intraacinar arterioles, thickened alveolar walls, and anomalously situated pulmonary veins running alongside pulmonary arterioles and sharing the same adventitial sheath. Less common features include a reduced number of alveoli and a patchy distribution of the histopathologic changes. Affected infants present with respiratory distress and the disease is fatal within the newborn period. Additional features include multiple congenital anomalies affecting the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal systems, as well as disruption of the normal right- left asymmetry of intrathoracic or intraabdominal organs. ACDMPV is a rare cause of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, an abnormal physiologic state caused by failure of transition of the pulmonary circulation from the high pulmonary vascular resistance of the fetus to the low pulmonary vascular resistance of the newborn.

DI-00105	canonical	Amyloidosis, primary localized cutaneous, 1.
DI-00105	definition	A primary amyloidosis characterized by localized cutaneous amyloid deposition. This condition usually presents with itching (especially on the lower legs) and visible changes of skin hyperpigmentation and thickening that may be exacerbated by chronic scratching and rubbing. Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis is often divided into macular and lichen subtypes although many affected individuals often show both variants coexisting. Lichen amyloidosis characteristically presents as a pruritic eruption of grouped hyperkeratotic papules with a predilection for the shins, calves, ankles and dorsa of feet and thighs. Papules may coalesce to form hyperkeratotic plaques that can resemble lichen planus, lichen simplex or nodular prurigo. Macular amyloidosis is characterized by small pigmented macules that may merge to produce macular hyperpigmentation, sometimes with a reticulate or rippled pattern. In macular and lichen amyloidosis, amyloid is deposited in the papillary dermis in association with grouped colloid bodies, thought to represent degenerate basal keratinocytes. The amyloid deposits probably reflect a combination of degenerate keratin filaments, serum amyloid P component, and deposition of immunoglobulins.

Protein fibrils can form in different tissues leading to amyloid polyneuropathies, amyloidotic cardiomyopathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, systemic senile amyloidosis. The disease includes leptomeningeal amyloidosis that is characterized by primary involvement of the central nervous system. Neuropathologic examination shows amyloid in the walls of leptomeningeal vessels, in pia arachnoid, and subpial deposits. Some patients also develop vitreous amyloid deposition that leads to visual impairment (oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis). Clinical features include seizures, stroke-like episodes, dementia, psychomotor deterioration, variable amyloid deposition in the vitreous humor.

DI-03316	definition	A rare anomaly of the ear that involves some degree of failure of the development of the external auditory canal. The malformation can also involve the tympanic membrane, ossicles and middle ear space. The inner ear development is most often normal. Different CAA forms are known. CAA type I is characterized by bony or fibrous atresia of the lateral part of the external auditory canal and an almost normal medial part and middle ear. CAA type II is the most frequent type and is characterized by partial or total aplasia of the external auditory canal. CAA type IIA involves an external auditory canal with either complete bony atresia of the medial part or partial aplasia that ends blindly in a fistula leading to a rudimentary tympanic membrane. CAA type IIB is characterized by bony stenosis of the total length of the external auditory canal. CAA type III involves bony atresia of the external auditory canal and a very small or absent middle-ear cavity.

DI-02878	canonical	Autoimmune thyroid disease 3.
DI-02878	definition	A complex autoimmune disorder comprising two related diseases affecting the thyroid: Graves disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis. In both disorders, thyroid-reactive T-cells are formed and infiltrate the thyroid gland. In Graves disease, the majority of the T-cells undergo a Th2 differentiation and activate B-cells to produce antibodies against the TSH receptor, which stimulate the thyroid and cause clinical hyperthyroidism. In contrast, Hashimoto thyroiditis is characterized by Th1 switching of the thyroid-infiltrating T-cells, which induces apoptosis of thyroid follicular cells and clinical hypothyroidism.

DI-03276	definition	A condition characterized by a metaplastic change in which normal esophageal squamous epithelium is replaced by a columnar and intestinal-type epithelium. Patients with Barrett esophagus have an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The main cause of Barrett esophagus is gastroesophageal reflux. The retrograde movement of acid and bile salts from the stomach into the esophagus causes prolonged injury to the esophageal epithelium and induces chronic esophagitis, which in turn is believed to trigger the pathologic changes.

DI-02606	definition	Drusen are extracellular deposits that accumulate below the retinal pigment epithelium on Bruch membrane. Basal laminar drusen refers to an early adult-onset drusen phenotype that shows a pattern of uniform small, slightly raised yellow subretinal nodules randomly scattered in the macula. In later stages, these drusen often become more numerous, with clustered groups of drusen scattered throughout the retina. In time these small basal laminar drusen may expand and ultimately lead to a serous pigment epithelial detachment of the macula that may result in vision loss.

DI-01275	definition	A form of thalassemia. Thalassemias are common monogenic diseases occurring mostly in Mediterranean and Southeast Asian populations. The hallmark of beta-thalassemia is an imbalance in globin-chain production in the adult HbA molecule. Absence of beta chain causes beta(0)-thalassemia, while reduced amounts of detectable beta globin causes beta(+)-thalassemia. In the severe forms of beta-thalassemia, the excess alpha globin chains accumulate in the developing erythroid precursors in the marrow. Their deposition leads to a vast increase in erythroid apoptosis that in turn causes ineffective erythropoiesis and severe microcytic hypochromic anemia. Clinically, beta-thalassemia is divided into thalassemia major which is transfusion dependent, thalassemia intermedia (of intermediate severity), and thalassemia minor that is asymptomatic.

DI-02727	definition	A rare neurologic disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and a variety of cranial nerve palsies, which develop over a relatively short period of time in a previously healthy individual. Sensorineural hearing loss may precede the neurological signs. The course is invariably progressive, but the rate of decline is variable within and between families. With disease evolution, long tract signs, lower motor neuron signs, cerebellar ataxia and lower cranial nerve (III-VI) palsies develop, giving rise to a complex picture resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Diaphragmatic weakness and respiratory compromise are some of the most distressing features, leading to recurrent chest infections and respiratory failure, which are often the cause of patients' demise.

DI-03780	canonical	Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome 3.
DI-03780	definition	A form of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, a multiple congenital anomaly disorder characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, heart defects and mental retardation. Heart defects include pulmonic stenosis, atrial septal defects and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Some affected individuals present with ectodermal abnormalities such as sparse, friable hair, hyperkeratotic skin lesions and a generalized ichthyosis-like condition. Typical facial features are similar to Noonan syndrome. They include high forehead with bitemporal constriction, hypoplastic supraorbital ridges, downslanting palpebral fissures, a depressed nasal bridge, and posteriorly angulated ears with prominent helices. Distinctive features of CFC3 include macrostomia and horizontal shape of palpebral fissures.

DI-02470	definition	An opacification of the crystalline lens of the eye that frequently results in visual impairment or blindness. Opacities vary in morphology, are often confined to a portion of the lens, and may be static or progressive. CTRCT1 includes congenital, zonular pulverulent, nuclear progressive, nuclear pulverulent, nuclear total, total, and posterior subcapsular types of cataract. Zonular or lamellar cataracts are opacities, broad or narrow, usually consisting of powdery white dots affecting only certain layers or zones between the cortex and nucleus of an otherwise clear lens. The opacity may be so dense as to render the entire central region of the lens completely opaque, or so translucent that vision is hardly if at all impeded. Zonular cataracts generally do not involve the embryonic nucleus, though sometimes they involve the fetal nucleus. Usually sharply separated from a clear cortex outside them, they may have projections from their outer edges known as riders or spokes. In some cases cataract is associated with microcornea without any other systemic anomaly or dysmorphism. Microcornea is defined by a corneal diameter inferior to 10 mm in both meridians in an otherwise normal eye.

Cerulean cataracts are characterized by peripheral bluish and white opacifications organized in concentric layers with occasional central lesions arranged radially. The opacities are observed in the superficial layers of the fetal nucleus as well as the adult nucleus of the lens. Involvement is usually bilateral. Visual acuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In adulthood, the opacifications may progress, making lens extraction necessary. Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform cavities between lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granular material. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dull blue is the most common appearance and is responsible for the designation cerulean cataract. Pulverulent cataracts are characterized by a dust- like, 'pulverised' appearance of the opacities which can be found in any part of the lens.

DI-01456	definition	An opacification of the crystalline lens of the eye that frequently results in visual impairment or blindness. Opacities vary in morphology, are often confined to a portion of the lens, and may be static or progressive. CTRCT4 includes crystalline aculeiform, congenital cerulean and non-nuclear polymorphic cataracts, among others. Crystalline aculeiform cataract is characterized by fiberglass-like or needle-like crystals projecting in different directions, through or close to the axial region of the lens. Non- nuclear polymorphic cataract is a partial opacity with variable location between the fetal nucleus of the lens and the equator. The fetal nucleus is normal. The opacities are irregular and look similar to a bunch of grapes and may be present simultaneously in different lens layers. Congenital cerulean cataract is characterized by peripheral bluish and white opacifications organized in concentric layers with occasional central lesions arranged radially. The opacities are observed in the superficial layers of the fetal nucleus as well as the adult nucleus of the lens. Involvement is usually bilateral. Visual acuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In adulthood, the opacifications may progress, making lens extraction necessary. Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform cavities between lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granular material. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dull blue is the most common appearance and is responsible for the designation cerulean cataract.

DI-00097	definition	A hereditary localized amyloidosis due to amyloid-beta A4 peptide(s) deposition in the cerebral vessels. The principal clinical characteristics are recurrent cerebral and cerebellar hemorrhages, recurrent strokes, cerebral ischemia, cerebral infarction, and progressive mental deterioration. Patients develop cerebral hemorrhage because of the severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Parenchymal amyloid deposits are rare and largely in the form of pre-amyloid lesions or diffuse plaque-like structures. They are Congo red negative and lack the dense amyloid cores commonly present in Alzheimer disease. Some affected individuals manifest progressive aphasic dementia, leukoencephalopathy, and occipital calcifications.

Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses are progressive neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage diseases characterized by intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent liposomal material, and clinically by seizures, dementia, visual loss, and/or cerebral atrophy. The hallmark of CLN3 is the ultrastructural pattern of lipopigment with a fingerprint profile, which can have 3 different appearances: pure within a lysosomal residual body; in conjunction with curvilinear or rectilinear profiles; and as a small component within large membrane- bound lysosomal vacuoles. The combination of fingerprint profiles within lysosomal vacuoles is a regular feature of blood lymphocytes from patients with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 3.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is classified in two main groups on the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (designated CMT1 when they are dominantly inherited) and primary peripheral axonal neuropathies (CMT2). Neuropathies of the CMT2 group are characterized by signs of axonal degeneration in the absence of obvious myelin alterations, normal or slightly reduced nerve conduction velocities, and progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy. Nerve conduction velocities are normal or slightly reduced.

DI-03924	definition	An axonal form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a disorder of the peripheral nervous system, characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy, initially of the peroneal muscles and later of the distal muscles of the arms. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is classified in two main groups on the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (designated CMT1 when they are dominantly inherited) and primary peripheral axonal neuropathies (CMT2). Neuropathies of the CMT2 group are characterized by signs of axonal degeneration in the absence of obvious myelin alterations, normal or slightly reduced nerve conduction velocities, and progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy. Nerve conduction velocities are normal or slightly reduced.

Demyelinating neuropathies are characterized by severely reduced nerve conduction velocities (less than 38 m/sec), segmental demyelination and remyelination with onion bulb formations on nerve biopsy, slowly progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, absent deep tendon reflexes, and hollow feet. By convention autosomal recessive forms of demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are designated CMT4. CMT4K patients manifest upper and lower limbs involvement. Some affected individuals have nystagmus and late-onset cerebellar ataxia.

Two clinical forms are recognized: in the classical form or Cockayne syndrome type 1, the symptoms are progressive and typically become apparent within the first few years or life; the less common Cockayne syndrome type 2 is characterized by more severe symptoms that manifest prenatally. Cockayne syndrome shows some overlap with certain forms of xeroderma pigmentosum. Unlike xeroderma pigmentosum, patients with Cockayne syndrome do not manifest increased freckling and other pigmentation abnormalities in the skin and have no significant increase in skin cancer.

Patients manifest, in the neonatal period, orofacial weakness with impaired sucking and swallowing, resulting in poor feeding. Affected infants show a tendency to startle, with contractions of the facial muscles in response to tactile stimuli or during crying, trismus, abundant salivation, and opisthotonus. These features are referred to as Crisponi syndrome and can result in early death in infancy. Patients who survive into childhood have hyperhidrosis, mainly of the upper body, in response to cold temperatures, and sweat very little with heat. Additional abnormalities include a high-arched palate, nasal voice, depressed nasal bridge, inability to fully extend the elbows and kyphoscoliosis.

Skin biopsies of palmoplantar lesions show hyperorthokeratosis, hypergranulosis, and acanthosis. Hypopigmented areas of skin, however, reveal a reduction in melanin content in keratinocytes but not in melanocytes, as well as hyperkeratosis and a normal number of melanocytes. Ultrastructurally, melanocytes show a disproportionately large number of melanosomes in the cytoplasm and dendrites, whereas keratinocytes show a paucity of these organelles, suggestive of impaired melanosome transfer. Some patients also exhibit calcinosis cutis or calcific tendinopathy.

DI-00317	definition	An autosomal dominant cone dystrophy. Cone dystrophies are retinal dystrophies characterized by progressive degeneration of the cone photoreceptors with preservation of rod function, as indicated by electroretinogram. However, some rod involvement may be present in some cone dystrophies, particularly at late stage. Affected individuals suffer from photophobia, loss of visual acuity, color vision and central visual field. Another sign is the absence of macular lesions for many years. Cone dystrophies are distinguished from the cone-rod dystrophies in which some loss of peripheral vision also occurs.

DI-01401	definition	Porphyrias are inherited defects in the biosynthesis of heme, resulting in the accumulation and increased excretion of porphyrins or porphyrin precursors. They are classified as erythropoietic or hepatic, depending on whether the enzyme deficiency occurs in red blood cells or in the liver. The manifestations of CEP are heterogeneous, ranging from nonimmune hydrops fetalis due to severe hemolytic anemia in utero to milder, later onset forms, which have only skin lesions due to cutaneous photosensitivity in adult life. The deficiency in UROS activity results in the non-enzymatic conversion of hydroxymethylbilane (HMB) into the uroporphyrinogen-I isomer.

An almost total lack of LCT activity is found in jejunal biopsy material of patients with congenital lactase deficiency. Opposite to congenital lactase deficiency, also known as lactose intolerance, is the most common enzyme deficiency worldwide. It is caused by developmental down- regulation of lactase activity during childhood or early adulthood. The decline of lactase activity is a normal physiological phenomenon; however, the majority of Northern Europeans have the ability to maintain lactase activity and digest lactose throughout life (lactase persistence). The down-regulation of lactase activity operates at the transcriptional level and it is associated with a noncoding variation in the MCM6 gene, located in the upstream vicinity of LCT.

DI-01416	definition	Aphakia is a rare congenital eye disorder in which the lens is missing. It has been histologically subdivided into primary and secondary forms, in accordance with the severity of defects of the ocular tissues, whose development requires the initial presence of a lens. CPA results from an early developmental arrest, around the 4th- 5th week of gestation in humans, that prevents the formation of any lens structure and leads to severe secondary ocular defects, including a complete aplasia of the anterior segment of the eye. In contrast, in secondary aphakic eyes, lens induction has occurred, and the lens vesicle has developed to some degree but finally has progressively resorbed perinatally, leading, therefore, to less-severe ocular defects.

The mean length of the small intestine in CSBS patients is approximately 50 cm, compared with a normal length at birth of 190-280 cm. Patients with CSBS may develop severe malnutrition as a result of the hugely reduced absorptive surface of the small intestine. Infants require parenteral nutrition for survival. However, parenteral nutrition itself causes life-threatening complications such as sepsis and liver failure which are associated with a high rate of mortality early in life.

DI-01419	definition	Autosomal recessive intestinal disorder that is clinically characterized by fermentative diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cramps upon ingestion of sugar. The symptoms are the consequence of absent or drastically reduced enzymatic activities of sucrase and isomaltase. The prevalence of CSID is 0.02 % in individuals of European descent and appears to be much higher in Greenland, Alaskan, and Canadian native people. CSID arises due to post-translational perturbations in the intracellular transport, polarized sorting, aberrant processing, and defective function of SI.

DI-01448	definition	Occurs primarily as a sporadic disorder (1 per million), while 10-15% are familial. Accidental transmission of CJD to humans appears to be iatrogenic (contaminated human growth hormone (HGH), corneal transplantation, electroencephalographic electrode implantation, etc.). Epidemiologic studies have failed to implicate the ingestion of infected animal meat in the pathogenesis of CJD in human. The triad of microscopic features that characterize the prion diseases consists of (1) spongiform degeneration of neurons, (2) severe astrocytic gliosis that often appears to be out of proportion to the degree of nerve cell loss, and (3) amyloid plaque formation. CJD is characterized by progressive dementia and myoclonic seizures, affecting adults in mid- life. Some patients present sleep disorders, abnormalities of high cortical function, cerebellar and corticospinal disturbances. The disease ends in death after a 3-12 months illness.

DI-01453	definition	Classic Crouzon disease which is caused by mutations in the FGFR2 gene is characterized by craniosynostosis (premature fusion of the skull sutures), and facial hypoplasia. Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans (a skin disorder characterized by pigmentation anomalies), CAN, is considered to be an independent disorder from classic Crouzon syndrome. CAN is characterized by additional more severe physical manifestation, such as Chiari malformation, hydrocephalus, and atresia or stenosis of the choanas, and is caused by a specific mutation (Ala- 391 to Glu) in the transmembrane domain of FGFR3. It is proposed to have an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.

DI-01473	canonical	Darier disease.
DI-01473	definition	A skin disorder characterized by warty papules and plaques in seborrheic areas (central trunk, flexures, scalp and forehead), palmoplantar pits and distinctive nail abnormalities. It is due to loss of adhesion between epidermal cells (acantholysis) and abnormal keratinization. Patients with mild disease may have no more than a few scattered keratotic papules or subtle nail changes, whereas those with severe disease are handicapped by widespread malodorous keratotic plaques. Some patients present with hemorrhage into acantholytic vesicles on the palms and dorsal aspects of the fingers which gives rise to black macules. In a few families affected by Darier disease, neuropsychiatric abnormalities such as mild mental retardation, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and epilepsy have been reported. Stress, UV exposure, heat, sweat, friction and oral contraception exacerbate disease symptoms. Clinical variants of Darier disease include hypertrophic, vesicobullous, hypopigmented, cornifying, zosteriform or linear, acute and comedonal subtypes. Comedonal Darier disease is characterized by the coexistence of acne-like comedonal lesions with typical Darier hyperkeratotic papules on light-exposed areas. At histopathologic level, comedonal Darier disease differs from classic Darier disease in the prominent follicular involvement and the presence of greatly elongated dermal villi.

DFNA6 is a low-frequency hearing loss in which frequencies of 2000 Hz and below are predominantly affected. Many patients have tinnitus, but there are otherwise no associated features such as vertigo. Because high-frequency hearing is generally preserved, patients retain excellent understanding of speech, although presbycusis or noise exposure may cause high-frequency loss later in life.

DI-04244	definition	A form of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. Sensorineural deafness results from damage to the neural receptors of the inner ear, the nerve pathways to the brain, or the area of the brain that receives sound information. DFNA65 is characterized by post-lingual onset of slowly progressive hearing loss in the third decade. Initially affecting the high frequencies, the hearing loss eventually affects all frequencies and results in severe to profound deafness in the seventh decade. Vestibular function is normal.

DI-00839	canonical	Deafness, autosomal dominant, 9.
DI-00839	definition	A form of non-syndromic hearing loss characterized by onset in the fourth or fifth decade of life and initially involves the high frequencies. Hearing loss is progressive and usually complete by the sixth decade. In addition to cochlear involvement, DFNA9 patients also exhibit a spectrum of vestibular dysfunctions. Penetrance of the vestibular symptoms is often incomplete, and some patients are minimally affected, whereas others suffer from severe balance disturbances and episodes of vertigo. Affected individuals have mucopolysaccharide depositions in the channels of the cochlear and vestibular nerves. These depositions apparently cause strangulation and degeneration of dendritic fibers.

DI-03801	canonical	Dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis with or without pseudohyperkalemia and/or perinatal edema.
DI-03801	definition	An autosomal dominant hemolytic anemia characterized by primary erythrocyte dehydration. DHS erythrocytes exhibit decreased total cation and potassium content that are not accompanied by a proportional net gain of sodium and water. DHS patients typically exhibit mild to moderate compensated hemolytic anemia, with an increased erythrocyte mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and a decreased osmotic fragility, both of which reflect cellular dehydration. Patients may also show perinatal edema and pseudohyperkalemia due to loss of potassium from red cells stored at room temperature. A minor proportion of red cells appear as stomatocytes on blood films. Complications such as splenomegaly and cholelithiasis, resulting from increased red cell trapping in the spleen and elevated bilirubin levels, respectively, may occur. The course of DHS is frequently associated with iron overload, which may lead to hepatosiderosis.

Distal spinal muscular atrophy, also known as distal hereditary motor neuronopathy, represents a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders caused by selective degeneration of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, without sensory deficit in the posterior horn. The overall clinical picture consists of a classical distal muscular atrophy syndrome in the legs without clinical sensory loss. The disease starts with weakness and wasting of distal muscles of the anterior tibial and peroneal compartments of the legs. Later on, weakness and atrophy may expand to the proximal muscles of the lower limbs and/or to the distal upper limbs. DSMA4 is characterized by childhood onset, generalized muscle weakness and atrophy with denervation and normal sensation. Bulbar symptoms and pyramidal signs are absent.

The FOAR syndrome was first described as comprising facial anomalies, ocular anomalies, sensorineural hearing loss, and proteinuria. DBS and FOAR were first described as distinct disorders but the classic distinguishing features between the 2 disorders were presence of proteinuria and absence of diaphragmatic hernia and corpus callosum anomalies in FOAR. Early reports noted that the 2 disorders shared many phenotypic features and may be identical. Although there is variability in the expression of some features (e.g., agenesis of the corpus callosum and proteinuria), DBS and FOAR are now considered to represent the same entity.

DI-00413	definition	A primary torsion dystonia, and the most common and severe form. Dystonia is defined by the presence of sustained involuntary muscle contractions, often leading to abnormal postures. Dystonia type 1 is characterized by involuntary, repetitive, sustained muscle contractions or postures involving one or more sites of the body, in the absence of other neurological symptoms. Typically, symptoms develop first in an arm or leg in middle to late childhood and progress in approximately 30% of patients to other body regions (generalized dystonia) within about five years. 'Torsion' refers to the twisting nature of body movements observed in DYT1, often affecting the trunk. Distribution and severity of symptoms vary widely between affected individuals, ranging from mild focal dystonia to severe generalized dystonia, even within families.

DI-01514	definition	Early-onset myopathies are inherited muscle disorders that manifest typically from birth or infancy with hypotonia, muscle weakness, and delayed motor development. EOMFC is a titinopathy that, in contrast with the previously described examples, involves both heart and skeletal muscle, has a congenital onset, and is purely recessive. This phenotype is due to homozygous out-of-frame TTN deletions, which lead to a total absence of titin's C-terminal end from striated muscles and to secondary CAPN3 depletion.

DI-00954	definition	An autosomal recessive and severe form of adolescent-onset progressive epilepsy. Typically, as seizures increase in frequency, cognitive function declines towards dementia, and affected individuals die usually within 10 years after onset. EPM2 occurs worldwide, but it is particularly common in the mediterranean countries of southern Europe and northern Africa, in southern India and in the Middle East. At the cellular level, it is characterized by accumulation of starch-like polyglucosans called Lafora bodies (LBs) that are most abundant in organs with the highest glucose metabolism: brain, heart, liver and skeletal muscle. Among other conditions involving polyglucosans, EPM2 is unique in that the inclusions are in neuronal dendrites but not axons and the forming polyglucosan fibrils are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.

DI-00955	definition	An autosomal recessive, severe, progressive myoclonic epilepsy with early onset. Multifocal myoclonic seizures begin between 16 and 24 months of age after normal initial development. Neurodegeneration and regression occur with seizure onset. Other features include mental retardation, dysarthria, truncal ataxia, and loss of fine finger movements. EEG shows slow dysrhythmia, multifocal and occasionally generalized epileptiform discharges. In some patients, ultrastructural findings on skin biopsies identify intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment storage material, consistent with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.

DI-01023	definition	A severe form of epileptic encephalopathy characterized by generalized tonic, clonic, and tonic-clonic seizures that are initially induced by fever and begin during the first year of life. Later, patients also manifest other seizure types, including absence, myoclonic, and simple and complex partial seizures. Psychomotor development delay is observed around the second year of life. Some patients manifest a borderline disease phenotype and do not necessarily fulfill all diagnostic criteria for core EIEE6. EIEE6 is considered to be the most severe phenotype within the spectrum of generalized epilepsies with febrile seizures-plus.

DI-02971	definition	A malignant disease which starts in the stomach, can spread to the esophagus or the small intestine, and can extend through the stomach wall to nearby lymph nodes and organs. It also can metastasize to other parts of the body. The term gastric cancer or gastric carcinoma refers to adenocarcinoma of the stomach that accounts for most of all gastric malignant tumors. Two main histologic types are recognized, diffuse type and intestinal type carcinomas. Diffuse tumors are poorly differentiated infiltrating lesions, resulting in thickening of the stomach. In contrast, intestinal tumors are usually exophytic, often ulcerating, and associated with intestinal metaplasia of the stomach, most often observed in sporadic disease.

They are histologically, immunohistochemically, and genetically different from typical leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas, and schwannomas. Most GISTs are composed of a fairly uniform population of spindle-shaped cells. Some tumors are dominated by epithelioid cells or contain a mixture of spindle and epithelioid morphologies. Primary GISTs in the gastrointestinal tract commonly metastasize in the omentum and mesenteries, often as multiple nodules. However, primary tumors may also occur outside of the gastrointestinal tract, in other intra-abdominal locations, especially in the omentum and mesentery.

DI-00522	definition	A metabolic disorder with a broad clinical spectrum. The severe infantile form, or Pompe disease, presents at birth with massive accumulation of glycogen in muscle, heart and liver. Cardiomyopathy and muscular hypotonia are the cardinal features of this form whose life expectancy is less than two years. The juvenile and adult forms present as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy beginning in the lower limbs. Final outcome depends on respiratory muscle failure. Patients with the adult form can be free of clinical symptoms for most of their life but finally develop a slowly progressive myopathy.

DI-00523	definition	A metabolic disorder associated with an accumulation of abnormal glycogen with short outer chains. It is clinically characterized by hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, short stature, and variable myopathy. Glycogen storage disease type 3 includes different forms: GSD type 3A patients lack glycogen debrancher enzyme activity in both liver and muscle, while GSD type 3B patients are enzyme-deficient in liver only. In rare cases, selective loss of only 1 of the 2 debranching activities, glucosidase or transferase, results in GSD type 3C or type 3D, respectively.

DI-00524	definition	A metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of an amylopectin-like polysaccharide. The typical clinical manifestation is liver disease of childhood, progressing to lethal hepatic cirrhosis. Most children with this condition die before two years of age. However, the liver disease is not always progressive. No treatment apart from liver transplantation has been found to prevent progression of the disease. There is also a neuromuscular form of glycogen storage disease type 4 that varies in onset (perinatal, congenital, juvenile, or adult) and severity.

Two subtypes are known: type 1 or classic type with no phosphorylase kinase activity in liver or erythrocytes, and type 2 or variant type with no phosphorylase kinase activity in liver, but normal activity in erythrocytes. Unlike other glycogenosis diseases, glycogen storage disease type 9A is generally a benign condition. Patients improve with age and are often asymptomatic as adults. Accurate diagnosis is therefore also of prognostic interest.

DI-00542	definition	A form of porphyria. Porphyrias are inherited defects in the biosynthesis of heme, resulting in the accumulation and increased excretion of porphyrins or porphyrin precursors. They are classified as erythropoietic or hepatic, depending on whether the enzyme deficiency occurs in red blood cells or in the liver. HEP is a cutaneous porphyria that presents in infancy. It is characterized biochemically by excessive excretion of acetate-substituted porphyrins and accumulation of protoporphyrin in erythrocytes. Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase levels are very low in erythrocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts.

DI-00550	definition	An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra- colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected.

FHC features include joint deformities, sensorineural hearing loss, and subsequent development of generalized lymphadenopathy and swellings in the eyelids that contain histiocytes. SHML causes lymph node enlargement in children frequently accompanied by fever, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. H syndrome is characterized by cutaneous hyperpigmentation and hypertrichosis, hepatosplenomegaly, heart anomalies, and hypogonadism; hearing loss is found in about half of patients. PHID is characterized by predominantly antibody-negative insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus associated with pigmented hypertrichosis and variable occurrence of other features of H syndrome.

The lesions appear as pearly papules or fleshy nodules. Additional features include gingival hypertrophy, progressive joint contractures resulting in severe limitation of mobility, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. Disease severity is variable. Some individuals manifest symptoms in infancy and have additional visceral or systemic involvement. Hyaline deposits in multiple organs, recurrent infections and intractable diarrhea often lead to early death. Surviving children may suffer from severely reduced mobility due to joint contractures. Other patients have later onset of a milder disorder affecting only the face and digits.

DI-03485	canonical	Hypertrichotic osteochondrodysplasia.
DI-03485	definition	A rare disorder characterized by congenital hypertrichosis, neonatal macrosomia, a distinct osteochondrodysplasia, and cardiomegaly. The hypertrichosis leads to thick scalp hair, which extends onto the forehead, and a general increase in body hair. In addition, macrocephaly and coarse facial features, including a broad nasal bridge, epicanthal folds, a wide mouth, and full lips, can be suggestive of a storage disorder. About half of affected individuals are macrosomic and edematous at birth, whereas in childhood they usually have a muscular appearance with little subcutaneous fat. Thickened calvarium, narrow thorax, wide ribs, flattened or ovoid vertebral bodies, coxa valga, osteopenia, enlarged medullary canals, and metaphyseal widening of long bones have been reported. Cardiac manifestations such as patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, and pericardial effusions are present in approximately 80% of cases. Motor development is usually delayed due to hypotonia. Most patients have a mild speech delay, and a small percentage have learning difficulties or intellectual disability.

In some cases, it is associated with non- reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin- releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH).

DI-03576	canonical	Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 16 with or without anosmia.
DI-03576	definition	A disorder characterized by absent or incomplete sexual maturation by the age of 18 years, in conjunction with low levels of circulating gonadotropins and testosterone and no other abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In some cases, it is associated with non- reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin- releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH).

Large, dark gray hyperkeratoses are observed in later weeks. The skin of IBS patients is unusually fragile and has a tendency to shed the outer layers of the epidermis, producing localized denuded areas (molting effect). IBS usually improves with age so that in most middle-aged patients the hyperkeratosis and keratotic lichenification is limited to the flexural folds of the major joints.

DI-04224	definition	A form of Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease, a rare condition caused by impairment of interferon-gamma mediated immunity. It is characterized by predisposition to illness caused by moderately virulent mycobacterial species, such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, environmental non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and by the more virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other microorganisms rarely cause severe clinical disease in individuals with susceptibility to mycobacterial infections, with the exception of Salmonella which infects less than 50% of these individuals. Clinical outcome severity depends on the degree of impairment of interferon-gamma mediated immunity. Some patients die of overwhelming mycobacterial disease with lepromatous-like lesions in early childhood, whereas others develop, later in life, disseminated but curable infections with tuberculoid granulomas. IMD31A has low penetrance, and affected individuals have relatively mild disease and good prognosis. IMD31A confers a predisposition to mycobacterial infections only, with no increased susceptibility to viral infections.

DI-01814	canonical	Immunoglobulin A deficiency 2.
DI-01814	definition	Selective deficiency of immunoglobulin A (IGAD) is the most common form of primary immunodeficiency, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 600 individuals in the western world. Individuals with symptomatic IGAD often have deficiency of IgG subclasses or decreased antibody response to carbohydrate antigens such as pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Individuals with IGAD also suffer from recurrent sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal infections and have an increased incidence of autoimmune disorders and of lymphoid and non-lymphoid malignancies. In vitro studies have suggested that some individuals with IGAD have impaired isotype class switching to IgA and others may have a post-switch defect. IGAD and CVID have been known to coexist in families. Some individuals initially present with IGAD1 and then develop CVID. These observations suggest that some cases of IGAD and CVID may have a common etiology.

JIP and HHT are autosomal dominant disorders with distinct and non-overlapping clinical features. The former, an inherited gastrointestinal malignancy predisposition, is caused by mutations in SMAD4 or BMPR1A, and the latter is a vascular malformation disorder caused by mutations in ENG or ACVRL1. All four genes encode proteins involved in the transforming-growth-factor-signaling pathway. Although there are reports of patients and families with phenotypes of both disorders combined, the genetic etiology of this association is unknown.

DI-03440	definition	An autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe global developmental delay, early-onset intractable seizures, spasticity, and amelogenesis imperfecta affecting both primary and secondary teeth and causing yellow or brown discoloration of the teeth. Although the phenotype is consistent, there is variability. Intellectual disability is related to the severity of seizures, and the disorder can thus be considered an epileptic encephalopathy. Some infants show normal development until seizure onset, whereas others are delayed from birth. The most severely affected individuals have profound mental retardation, never acquire speech, and become bedridden early in life.

DI-01887	definition	Severe neurological disorder characterized by bilaterally symmetrical necrotic lesions in subcortical brain regions that is commonly associated with systemic cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency. In the Saguenay-Lac Saint Jean region of Quebec province in Canada, a biochemically distinct form of Leigh syndrome with COX deficiency has been described. Patients have been observed to have a developmental delay, hypotonia, mild facial dysmorphism, chronic well-compensated metabolic acidosis, and high mortality due to episodes of severe acidosis and coma. Enzyme activity was close to normal in kidney and heart, 50% of normal in fibroblasts and skeletal muscle, and nearly absent in brain and liver. LSFC patients show reduced (<30%) levels of LRPPRC in both fibroblast and liver mitochondria and a specifically reduced translation of COX subunits MT-CO1/COXI and MT-CO3 (COXIII).

DI-00654	definition	A leukodystrophy that occurs mainly in children. Neurological signs include progressive cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, inconstant optic atrophy and relatively preserved mental abilities. The disease is chronic-progressive with, in most individuals, additional episodes of rapid deterioration following febrile infections or minor head trauma. While childhood onset is the most common form of the disorder, some severe forms are apparent at birth. A severe, early-onset form seen among the Cree and Chippewayan populations of Quebec and Manitoba is called Cree leukoencephalopathy. Milder forms may not become evident until adolescence or adulthood. Some females with milder forms of the disease who survive to adolescence exhibit ovarian dysfunction. This variant of the disorder is called ovarioleukodystrophy.

DI-00647	definition	An autosomal recessive disorder characterized by insufficient catabolism of several galactolipids that are important for normal myelin production. Four clinical forms are recognized. The infantile form accounts for 90% of cases. It manifests before six months of age with irritability, spasticity, arrest of motor and mental development, and bouts of temperature elevation without infection. This is followed by myoclonic jerks of arms and legs, oposthotonus, hypertonic fits, and mental regression, which progresses to a severe decerebrate condition with no voluntary movements and death from respiratory infections or cerebral hyperpyrexia before 2 years of age. Cases with later onset present with unexplained blindness, weakness and sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, mental deterioration and death.

DI-00765	definition	A disorder characterized by dermal, ocular, neurological and cardiac abnormalities. LSDMCA1 main features are unilateral or bilateral microphthalmia, linear skin defects in affected females, and in utero lethality for males. Skin defects are limited to the face and neck, consisting of areas of aplastic skin that heal with age to form hyperpigmented areas. Additional features in female patients include agenesis of the corpus callosum, sclerocornea, chorioretinal abnormalities, infantile seizures, congenital heart defect, mental retardation, and diaphragmatic hernia. Microphthalmia is a disorder of eye formation, ranging from small size of a single eye to complete bilateral absence of ocular tissues (anophthalmia). In many cases, microphthalmia/anophthalmia occurs in association with syndromes that include non-ocular abnormalities.

DI-01925	definition	An ocular disease characterized by bilateral, progressive corneal opacification, and reduced corneal sensitivity. Onset occurs in the first decade, usually between ages 5 and 9. Painful attacks with photophobia, foreign body sensations, and recurrent erosions occur in most patients. The disease is due to deposition of an unsulfated keratan sulfate both within the intracellular space (within the keratocytes and endothelial cells) and in the extracellular corneal stroma. Macular corneal dystrophy is divided into the clinically indistinguishable types I, IA, and II based on analysis of the normally sulfated, or antigenic, keratan sulfate levels in serum and immunohistochemical evaluation of the cornea. Patients with types I and IA macular corneal dystrophy have undetectable serum levels of antigenic keratan sulfate, whereas those with type II macular corneal dystrophy have normal or low levels, depending on the population examined.

DI-01929	canonical	Malignant hyperthermia 1.
DI-01929	definition	Autosomal dominant pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle and is one of the main causes of death due to anesthesia. In susceptible people, an MH episode can be triggered by all commonly used inhalational anesthetics such as halothane and by depolarizing muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine. The clinical features of the myopathy are hyperthermia, accelerated muscle metabolism, contractures, metabolic acidosis, tachycardia and death, if not treated with the postsynaptic muscle relaxant, dantrolene. Susceptibility to MH can be determined with the 'in vitro' contracture test (IVCT): observing the magnitude of contractures induced in strips of muscle tissue by caffeine alone and halothane alone. Patients with normal response are MH normal (MHN), those with abnormal response to caffeine alone or halothane alone are MH equivocal (MHE(C) and MHE(H) respectively).

DI-01934	definition	A metabolic disorder due to an enzyme defect in the catabolic pathway of the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Accumulation of these 3 amino acids and their corresponding keto acids leads to encephalopathy and progressive neurodegeneration. Clinical features include mental and physical retardation, feeding problems, and a maple syrup odor to the urine. The keto acids of the branched- chain amino acids are present in the urine. If untreated, maple syrup urine disease can lead to seizures, coma, and death. The disease is often classified by its pattern of signs and symptoms. The most common and severe form of the disease is the classic type, which becomes apparent soon after birth. Variant forms of the disorder become apparent later in infancy or childhood and are typically milder, but they still involve developmental delay and other medical problems if not treated.

Features of megalocornea in addition to a deep anterior chamber include astigmatic refractive errors, atrophy of the iris stroma, miosis secondary to decreased function of the dilator muscle, iridodonesis, and tremulousness, subluxation, or dislocation of the lens. Whereas most affected individuals exhibit normal ocular function, complications include cataract development and glaucoma following lenticular dislocation or subluxation.

DI-04099	definition	A syndrome characterized by congenital pigmentary skin lesions which can occur at any site and can cover most of the body surface. These lesions may or may not be hairy. Congenital melanocytic nevi are associated with neuromelanosis (the presence of melanin-producing cells within the brain parenchyma or leptomeninges). Less commonly they are associated with malignant melanoma in childhood, both in the skin and the central nervous system. CMNS patients also tend to have a characteristic facial appearance, including wide or prominent forehead, periorbital fullness, small short nose with narrow nasal bridge, round face, full cheeks, prominent premaxilla, and everted lower lip.

DI-00751	definition	A disease defined as a head circumference more than 3 standard deviations below the age-related mean. Brain weight is markedly reduced and the cerebral cortex is disproportionately small. Despite this marked reduction in size, the gyral pattern is relatively well preserved, with no major abnormality in cortical architecture. Affected individuals are mentally retarded. Primary microcephaly is further defined by the absence of other syndromic features or significant neurological deficits due to degenerative brain disorder. Some MCHP1 patients also present growth retardation, short stature, and misregulated chromosome condensation as indicated by a high number of prophase-like cells detected in routine cytogenetic preparations and poor-quality metaphase G-banding.

DI-02934	definition	A form of migraine transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern. Migraine is a disabling symptom complex of periodic headaches, usually temporal and unilateral. Headaches are often accompanied by irritability, nausea, vomiting and photophobia, preceded by constriction of the cranial arteries. The two major subtypes are common migraine (migraine without aura) and classic migraine (migraine with aura). Classic migraine is characterized by recurrent attacks of reversible neurological symptoms (aura) that precede or accompany the headache. Aura may include a combination of sensory disturbances, such as blurred vision, hallucinations, vertigo, numbness and difficulty in concentrating and speaking.

Unlike the related diseases, mucolipidosis II and IIIA, the enzyme affected in mucolipidosis IIIC (GlcNAc-phosphotransferase) retains full transferase activity on synthetic substrates but lacks activity on lysosomal hydrolases. Typical clinical findings include stiffness of the hands and shoulders, claw-hand deformity, scoliosis, short stature, coarse facies, and mild mental retardation. Radiographically, severe dysostosis multiplex of the hip is characteristic and frequently disabling. The clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by finding elevated serum lysosomal enzyme levels and/or decreased lysosomal enzyme levels in cultured fibroblasts.

Most children with MPS2 have a severe form with early somatic abnormalities including skeletal deformities, hepatosplenomegaly, and progressive cardiopulmonary deterioration. A prominent feature is neurological damage that presents as developmental delay and hyperactivity but progresses to mental retardation and dementia. They die before 15 years of age, usually as a result of obstructive airway disease or cardiac failure. In contrast, those with a mild form of MPS2 may survive into adulthood, with attenuated somatic complications and often without mental retardation.

DI-04397	canonical	Myasthenic syndrome, congenital, 4A, slow-channel.
DI-04397	definition	A form of congenital myasthenic syndrome, a group of disorders characterized by failure of neuromuscular transmission, including pre- synaptic, synaptic, and post-synaptic disorders that are not of autoimmune origin. Clinical features are easy fatigability and muscle weakness affecting the axial and limb muscles (with hypotonia in early-onset forms), the ocular muscles (leading to ptosis and ophthalmoplegia), and the facial and bulbar musculature (affecting sucking and swallowing, and leading to dysphonia). The symptoms fluctuate and worsen with physical effort. CMS4A is a slow-channel myasthenic syndrome. It is caused by kinetic abnormalities of the AChR, resulting in prolonged AChR channel opening episodes, prolonged endplate currents, and depolarization block. This is associated with calcium overload, which may contribute to subsequent degeneration of the endplate and postsynaptic membrane.

Clinical features are easy fatigability and muscle weakness affecting the axial and limb muscles (with hypotonia in early-onset forms), the ocular muscles (leading to ptosis and ophthalmoplegia), and the facial and bulbar musculature (affecting sucking and swallowing, and leading to dysphonia). The symptoms fluctuate and worsen with physical effort. CMS4B is a fast-channel myasthenic syndrome. It is caused by kinetic abnormalities of the AChR, resulting in brief opening and activity of the channel, with a rapid decay in endplate current, failure to achieve threshold depolarization of the endplate and consequent failure to fire an action potential.

Additional features are dysphagia resulting in poor feeding, failure to thrive, poor head control, facial weakness, cleft palate, contractures and scoliosis. Affected individuals become ventilator-dependent, and most require feeding by gastrostomy. The disorder results in severe muscle weakness and most patients never achieve walking. Death from respiratory failure in childhood occurs in about half of patients. Muscle biopsies from affected individuals show myopathic changes, replacement of myofibers with fatty tissue, small and incompletely fused muscle fibers, and variation in fiber size. Short regions of sarcomeric disorganization with few or no mitochondria (minicores) have been observed in some cases.

DI-01216	canonical	Myotonia congenita, autosomal dominant.
DI-01216	definition	A non-dystrophic skeletal muscle disorder characterized by muscle stiffness and an inability of the muscle to relax after voluntary contraction. Most patients have symptom onset in the legs, which later progresses to the arms, neck, and facial muscles. Many patients show marked hypertrophy of the lower limb muscles. The autosomal dominant form (Thomsen disease) is less common and less severe than the autosomal recessive one (Becker disease). A milder form of autosomal dominant myotonia is characterized by isolated myotonia without muscle weakness, hypotrophy, or hypertrophy (myotonia levior).

DI-00796	canonical	Myotonia SCN4A-related.
DI-00796	definition	A phenotypically highly variable myotonia aggravated by potassium loading, and sometimes by cold. Myotonia is characterized by sustained muscle tensing that prevents muscles from relaxing normally. It causes muscle stiffness that can interfere with movement. In some people the stiffness is very mild, while in other cases it may be severe enough to interfere with walking, running, and other activities of daily life. Myotonia SCN4A-related includes myotonia permanens and myotonia fluctuans. In myotonia permanens, the myotonia is generalized and there is a hypertrophy of the muscle, particularly in the neck and the shoulder. Attacks of severe muscle stiffness of the thoracic muscles may be life threatening due to impaired ventilation. In myotonia fluctuans, the muscle stiffness may fluctuate from day to day, provoked by exercise.

Clinical manifestations include progressive muscle spasticity, hyperreflexia, muscle rigidity, dystonia, dysarthria, and intellectual deterioration which progresses to severe dementia over several years. It is clinically classified into classic, atypical, and intermediate phenotypes. Classic forms present with onset in first decade, rapid progression, loss of independent ambulation within 15 years. Atypical forms have onset in second decade, slow progression, maintenance of independent ambulation up to 40 years later. Intermediate forms manifest onset in first decade with slow progression or onset in second decade with rapid progression. Patients with early onset tend to also develop pigmentary retinopathy, whereas those with later onset tend to also have speech disorders and psychiatric features. All patients have the 'eye of the tiger' sign on brain MRI.

DI-03508	definition	A disorder characterized by distal muscular atrophy mainly affecting the upper extremities, in contrast to other distal motor neuronopathies. These constitute a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular diseases caused by selective degeneration of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, without sensory deficit in the posterior horn. The overall clinical picture consists of a classical distal muscular atrophy syndrome in the legs without clinical sensory loss. The disease starts with weakness and wasting of distal muscles of the anterior tibial and peroneal compartments of the legs. Later on, weakness and atrophy may expand to the proximal muscles of the lower limbs and/or to the distal upper limbs. HMN5B is characterized by onset in the first or second decade of distal muscle weakness and atrophy, primarily affecting the intrinsic hand muscles, but also affecting the lower legs, resulting in abnormal gait and pes cavus.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a disorder of the peripheral nervous system, characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy, initially of the peroneal muscles and later of the distal muscles of the arms. It is classified in two main groups on the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies and primary peripheral axonal neuropathies. Peripheral axonal neuropathies are characterized by signs of axonal regeneration in the absence of obvious myelin alterations, and normal or slightly reduced nerve conduction velocities.

It results in the accumulation of sphingomyelin and other metabolically related lipids in reticuloendothelial and other cell types throughout the body, leading to cell death. Niemann-Pick disease type A is a primarily neurodegenerative disorder characterized by onset within the first year of life, mental retardation, digestive disorders, failure to thrive, major hepatosplenomegaly, and severe neurologic symptoms. The severe neurological disorders and pulmonary infections lead to an early death, often around the age of four. Clinical features are variable. A phenotypic continuum exists between type A (basic neurovisceral) and type B (purely visceral) forms of Niemann-Pick disease, and the intermediate types encompass a cluster of variants combining clinical features of both types A and B.

It results in the accumulation of sphingomyelin and other metabolically related lipids in reticuloendothelial and other cell types throughout the body, leading to cell death. Clinical signs involve only visceral organs. The most constant sign is hepatosplenomegaly which can be associated with pulmonary symptoms. Patients remain free of neurologic manifestations. However, a phenotypic continuum exists between type A (basic neurovisceral) and type B (purely visceral) forms of Niemann-Pick disease, and the intermediate types encompass a cluster of variants combining clinical features of both types A and B. In Niemann-Pick disease type B, onset of the first symptoms occurs in early childhood and patients can survive into adulthood.

DI-00377	definition	A non-progressive retinal disorder characterized by impaired night vision. Congenital stationary night blindness type 1B is an autosomal recessive form associated with a negative electroretinogram waveform. Patients are night blind from an early age, and when maximally dark- adapted, they could perceive lights only with an intensity equal to or slightly dimmer than that normally detected by the cone system. ERGs in response to single brief flashes of light have clearly detectable a-waves, which are derived from photoreceptors, and greatly reduced b- waves, which are derived from the second-order inner retinal neurons. ERGs in response to sawtooth flickering light indicate a markedly reduced on response and a nearly normal OFF response. There is no subjective delay in the perception of suddenly appearing white vs black objects on a gray background.

DI-02713	canonical	Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.
DI-02713	definition	An ocular disease due to ischemic injury to the optic nerve. It usually affects the optic disk and leads to visual loss and optic disk swelling of a pallid nature. Visual loss is usually sudden, or over a few days at most and is usually permanent, with some recovery possibly occurring within the first weeks or months. Patients with small disks having smaller or non-existent cups have an anatomical predisposition for non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. As an ischemic episode evolves, the swelling compromises circulation, with a spiral of ischemia resulting in further neuronal damage.

NAIC typically presents with transient neonatal jaundice, in a child who is otherwise healthy, and progresses to biliary cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Biochemical and histopathological features suggest involvement of the bile ducts rather than of the bile canaliculi. They include elevated gamma glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels, and, typically, marked fibrosis around bile ducts. Clinically, NAIC is distinct from other nonsyndromic familial cholestases because of its marked cholangiopathic features and severe degree of fibrosis on liver histology.

DI-01251	canonical	Oculodentodigital dysplasia, autosomal recessive.
DI-01251	definition	A disease characterized by a typical facial appearance and variable involvement of the eyes, dentition, and fingers. Characteristic facial features include a narrow, pinched nose with hypoplastic alae nasi, prominent columella and thin anteverted nares together with a narrow nasal bridge, and prominent epicanthic folds giving the impression of hypertelorism. The teeth are usually small and carious. Typical eye findings include microphthalmia and microcornea. The characteristic digital malformation is complete syndactyly of the fourth and fifth fingers (syndactyly type III) but the third finger may be involved and associated camptodactyly is a common finding. Cardiac abnormalities are observed in rare instances.

OPD1 belongs to a group of X-linked skeletal dysplasias known as oto- palato-digital syndrome spectrum disorders that also include OPD2, Melnick-Needles syndrome (MNS), and frontometaphyseal dysplasia (FMD). Remodeling of the cytoskeleton is central to the modulation of cell shape and migration. FLNA is a widely expressed protein that regulates re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton by interacting with integrins, transmembrane receptor complexes and second messengers. Males with OPD1 have cleft palate, malformations of the ossicles causing deafness and milder bone and limb defects than those associated with OPD2. Obligate female carriers of mutations causing both OPD1 and OPD2 have variable (often milder) expression of a similar phenotypic spectrum.

DI-02258	definition	An autosomal dominant disorder characterized by both ocular and renal anomalies, but may also include vesicoureteral reflux, high frequency hearing loss, central nervous system anomalies, and/or genital anomalies. Eye anomalies in this disorder consist of a wide and sometimes excavated dysplastic optic disk with the emergence of the retinal vessels from the periphery of the disk, designated optic nerve coloboma or 'morning glory' anomaly. Associated findings may include a small corneal diameter, retinal coloboma, scleral staphyloma, optic nerve cyst, microphthalmia, and pigmentary macular dysplasia. The kidneys are small and abnormally formed (renal hypodysplasia), and have fewer than the normal number of glomeruli, which are enlarged (oligomeganephronia). These ocular and renal anomalies result in decreased visual acuity and retinal detachment, as well as hypertension, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency that frequently progresses to end-stage renal disease.

Two forms of the disorder are distinguished: type 1 deficiency is additionally characterized by decreased plasminogen antigen levels and clinical symptoms, whereas type 2 deficiency, also known as dysplasminogenemia, is characterized by normal, or slightly reduced antigen levels, and absence of clinical manifestations. Plasminogen deficiency type 1 results in markedly impaired extracellular fibrinolysis and chronic mucosal pseudomembranous lesions due to subepithelial fibrin deposition and inflammation. The most common clinical manifestation of type 1 deficiency is ligneous conjunctivitis in which pseudomembranes formation on the palpebral surfaces of the eye progresses to white, yellow-white, or red thick masses with a wood-like consistency that replace the normal mucosa.

It lacks malignant epithelial elements, a feature that distinguishes it from the classic adult-type pulmonary blastoma. It arises during fetal lung development and is often part of an inherited cancer syndrome. The tumor contain both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Early in tumorigenesis, cysts form in lung airspaces, and these cysts are lined with benign-appearing epithelium. Mesenchymal cells susceptible to malignant transformation reside within the cyst walls and form a dense layer beneath the epithelial lining. In a subset of patients, overgrowth of the mesenchymal cells produces a sarcoma, a transition that is associated with a poorer prognosis. Some patients have multilocular cystic nephroma, a benign kidney tumor.

DI-02620	canonical	Poikiloderma with neutropenia.
DI-02620	definition	A genodermatosis characterized by poikiloderma, pachyonychia and chronic neutropenia. The disorder starts as a papular erythematous rash on the limbs during the first year of life. It gradually spreads centripetally and, as the papular rash resolves, hypo- and hyperpigmentation result, with development of telangiectasias. Another skin manifestation is pachyonychia, but alopecia and leukoplakia are distinctively absent. Patients have recurrent pneumonias that usually result in reactive airway disease and/or chronic cough. One of the most important extracutaneous symptoms is an increased susceptibility to infections, mainly affecting the respiratory system, primarily due to a chronic neutropenia and to neutrophil functional defects. Bone marrow abnormalities account for neutropenia and may evolve into myelodysplasia associated with the risk of leukemic transformation. Poikiloderma with neutropenia shows phenotypic overlap with Rothmund- Thomson syndrome.

DI-00927	canonical	Polycystic kidney disease, autosomal recessive.
DI-00927	definition	A severe form of polycystic kidney disease affecting the kidneys and the hepatic biliary tract. The clinical spectrum is widely variable, with most cases presenting during infancy. The fetal phenotypic features classically include enlarged and echogenic kidneys, as well as oligohydramnios secondary to a poor urine output. Up to 50% of the affected neonates die shortly after birth, as a result of severe pulmonary hypoplasia and secondary respiratory insufficiency. In the subset that survives the perinatal period, morbidity and mortality are mainly related to severe systemic hypertension, renal insufficiency, and portal hypertension due to portal-tract fibrosis.

Nyctalopia (night blindness) and peripheral visual field loss are usually evident during late childhood or teenage years, with subsequent progressive constriction of the visual fields and loss of central retinal function over time. A sensory ataxia caused by degeneration of the posterior columns of the spinal cord results in a loss of proprioceptive sensation that is clinically evident in the second decade of life and gradually progresses. Scoliosis, camptodactyly, achalasia, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and a sensory peripheral neuropathy are variable features of the disease. Affected individuals have no clinical or radiological evidence of cerebral or cerebellar involvement.

DI-02208	definition	Condition in which air is present in the pleural space in the absence of a precipitating event, such as trauma or lung disease. This results in secondary collapse of the lung, either partially or completely, and some degree of hypoxia. PSP is relatively common, with an incidence between 7.4-18/100'000 for men and 1.2-6/100'000 for women and a dose- dependent, increased risk among smokers. Most cases are sporadic, typically occurring in tall, thin men aged 10-30 years and generally while at rest. Familial PSP is rarer and usually is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition with reduced penetrance, although X- linked recessive and autosomal recessive inheritance have also been suggested.

Most patients are asymptomatic for several years or even for decades and generally, the diagnosis is incidental to clinical investigations unrelated to the disease. Cases with early-onset or rapid progression are rare. A 'sandstorm- appearing' chest roentgenogram is a typical diagnostic finding. The onset of this potentially lethal disease varies from the neonatal period to old age and the disease follows a long-term, progressive course, resulting in a slow deterioration of lung functions. Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is a recessive monogenic disease with full penetrance.

DI-02450	definition	A vitreo-retinal dystrophy characterized by macular pathology and by splitting of the superficial layer of the retina. Macular changes are present in almost all cases. In the fundi, radially oriented intraretinal foveomacular cysts are seen in a spoke-wheel configuration, with the absence of foveal reflex in most cases. In addition, approximately half of cases have bilateral peripheral retinoschisis in the inferotemporal part of the retina. Aside from the typical fundus appearance, strabismus, nystagmus, axial hyperopia, defective color vision and foveal ectopy can be present. The most important complications are vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma.

DI-02247	canonical	Robinow syndrome autosomal recessive.
DI-02247	definition	A recessive form of Robinow syndrome, a disease characterized by short-limb dwarfism, costovertebral segmentation defects and abnormalities of the head, face and external genitalia. The clinical signs are generally far more severe in recessive cases, particularly skeletal abnormalities. All patients with the recessive form suffer from vertebral segmentation abnormalities, resulting in scoliosis and chest deformities. Rib fusions are considered to be characteristic of the autosomal recessive form. Patients can also present brachydactyly, with extensive aplasia/hypoplasia of the phalanges and metacarpals/metatarsals, and brachy-syn-polydactyly of the hands and oligodactyly of the feet.

Although it affects emotions, it is distinguished from mood disorders in which such disturbances are primary. Similarly, there may be mild impairment of cognitive function, and it is distinguished from the dementias in which disturbed cognitive function is considered primary. Some patients manifest schizophrenic as well as bipolar disorder symptoms and are often given the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder.

DI-00182	definition	A disorder characterized by clusters of seizures occurring in the first days of life. Most patients have spontaneous remission by 12 months of age and show normal psychomotor development. Some rare cases manifest an atypical severe phenotype associated with epileptic encephalopathy and psychomotor retardation. The disorder is distinguished from benign familial infantile seizures by an earlier age at onset. In some patients, neonatal convulsions are followed later in life by myokymia, a benign condition characterized by spontaneous involuntary contractions of skeletal muscles fiber groups that can be observed as vermiform movement of the overlying skin. Electromyography typically shows continuous motor unit activity with spontaneous oligo- and multiplet-discharges of high intraburst frequency (myokymic discharges). Some patients may have isolated myokymia.

SCID refers to a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of rare congenital disorders characterized by impairment of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity, leukopenia, and low or absent antibody levels. Patients with SCID present in infancy with recurrent, persistent infections by opportunistic organisms. The common characteristic of all types of SCID is absence of T-cell- mediated cellular immunity due to a defect in T-cell development. ADA deficiency has been diagnosed in chronically ill teenagers and adults (late or adult onset). Population and newborn screening programs have also identified several healthy individuals with normal immunity who have partial ADA deficiency.

DI-01053	definition	An X-linked recessive form of spinal muscular atrophy. Spinal muscular atrophy refers to a group of neuromuscular disorders characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, leading to symmetrical muscle weakness and atrophy. SMAX1 occurs only in men. Age at onset is usually in the third to fifth decade of life, but earlier involvement has been reported. It is characterized by slowly progressive limb and bulbar muscle weakness with fasciculations, muscle atrophy, and gynecomastia. The disorder is clinically similar to classic forms of autosomal spinal muscular atrophy.

DI-01055	definition	A form of spinal muscular atrophy, a group of neuromuscular disorder characterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, leading to symmetrical muscle weakness and atrophy. Autosomal recessive forms are classified according to the age of onset, the maximum muscular activity achieved, and survivorship. The severity of the disease is mainly determined by the copy number of SMN2, a copy gene which predominantly produces exon 7-skipped transcripts and only low amount of full-length transcripts that encode for a protein identical to SMN1. Only about 4% of SMA patients bear one SMN1 copy with an intragenic mutation. SMA1 is a severe form, with onset before 6 months of age. SMA1 patients never achieve the ability to sit.

Patients show progressive incoordination of gait and often poor coordination of hands, speech and eye movements, due to cerebellum degeneration with variable involvement of the brainstem and spinal cord. SCA1 belongs to the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias type I (ADCA I) which are characterized by cerebellar ataxia in combination with additional clinical features like optic atrophy, ophthalmoplegia, bulbar and extrapyramidal signs, peripheral neuropathy and dementia. SCA1 is caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the coding region of ATXN1. Longer expansions result in earlier onset and more severe clinical manifestations of the disease.

Patients show progressive incoordination of gait and often poor coordination of hands, speech and eye movements, due to cerebellum degeneration with variable involvement of the brainstem and spinal cord. SCA3 belongs to the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias type I (ADCA I) which are characterized by cerebellar ataxia in combination with additional clinical features like optic atrophy, ophthalmoplegia, bulbar and extrapyramidal signs, peripheral neuropathy and dementia. The molecular defect in SCA3 is the a CAG repeat expansion in ATX3 coding region. Longer expansions result in earlier onset and more severe clinical manifestations of the disease.

It includes a spectrum of related disorders comprising ankylosing spondylitis, a subset of psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis (e.g. Reiter syndrome), arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease and undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy. These disorders may occur simultaneously or sequentially in the same patient, probably representing various phenotypic expressions of the same disease. Ankylosing spondylitis is the form of rheumatoid arthritis affecting the spine and is considered the prototype of seronegative spondyloarthropathies. It produces pain and stiffness as a result of inflammation of the sacroiliac, intervertebral, and costovertebral joints.

DI-03363	definition	A bone disease characterized by short stature, distinctive midface retrusion, progressive knee malalignment (genu valgum and/or varum), generalized ligamentous laxity, and mild spinal deformity. Intellectual development is not impaired. Radiographic characteristics include significantly retarded epiphyseal ossification that evolves into epiphyseal dysplasia and precocious osteoarthritis, metaphyseal irregularities and vertical striations, constricted femoral neck, slender metacarpals and metatarsals, and mild thoracolumbar kyphosis or scoliosis with normal or mild platyspondyly. The most distinctive features for differential diagnosis of SEMDJL2 are the slender metacarpals and phalanges and the progressive degeneration of carpal bones; however, these 2 features are evident only in older children and young adults. The soft consistency of cartilage in the airways leads to laryngotracheomalacia with proneness to respiratory obstruction and inspiratory stridor in infancy and childhood.

DI-01096	canonical	Sudden infant death syndrome.
DI-01096	definition	SIDS is the sudden death of an infant younger than 1 year that remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of clinical history. Pathophysiologic mechanisms for SIDS may include respiratory dysfunction, cardiac dysrhythmias, cardiorespiratory instability, and inborn errors of metabolism, but definitive pathogenic mechanisms precipitating an infant sudden death remain elusive.

DI-02346	definition	Autosomal recessive disorder. Affected infants appear normal at birth, develop signs of visceroautonomic dysfunction early in life, and die before 12 months of age of abrupt cardiorespiratory arrest. Features included bradycardia, hypothermia, severe gastroesophageal reflux, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and abnormal cardiorespiratory patterns during sleep. Genotypic males with SIDDT had fetal testicular dysgenesis and ambiguous genitalia, with findings such as intraabdominal testes, dysplastic testes, deficient fetal testosterone production, fusion and rugation of the gonadal sac, and partial development of the penile shaft. Female sexual development was normal. Affected infants had an unusual staccato cry, similar to the cry of a goat.

DI-02526	definition	A disorder due to thyroid dyshormonogenesis, causing large goiters of elastic and soft consistency in the majority of patients. Although the degree of thyroid dysfunction varies considerably among patients with defective thyroglobulin synthesis, patients usually have a relatively high serum free triiodothyronine (T3) concentration with disproportionately low free tetraiodothyronine (T4) level. The maintenance of relatively high free T3 levels prevents profound tissue hypothyroidism except in brain and pituitary, which are dependent on T4 supply, resulting in neurologic and intellectual defects in some cases.

DI-02368	definition	A sporadic muscular disorder characterized by episodic weakness and hypokalemia during a thyrotoxic state. It is clinically similar to hereditary hypokalemic periodic paralysis, except for the fact that hyperthyroidism is an absolute requirement for disease manifestation. The disease presents with recurrent episodes of acute muscular weakness of the four extremities that vary in severity from paresis to complete paralysis. Attacks are triggered by ingestion of a high carbohydrate load or strenuous physical activity followed by a period of rest. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis can occur in association with any cause of hyperthyroidism, but is most commonly associated with Graves disease.

DI-02839	definition	A form of nephrolithiasis, a common multifactorial disease characterized by stones formation in the kidney and urinary tract. Nephrolithiasis is due to supersaturation of the urine by stone- forming constituents, including calcium, oxalate and uric acid. Crystals or foreign bodies can act as nidi, upon which ions from the supersaturated urine form microscopic crystalline structures. Uric acid nephrolithiasis occurs when the urine becomes overly concentrated with uric acid and accounts for 20% of all stones.

DI-00928	canonical	Variegate porphyria.
DI-00928	definition	A form of porphyria. Porphyrias are inherited defects in the biosynthesis of heme, resulting in the accumulation and increased excretion of porphyrins or porphyrin precursors. They are classified as erythropoietic or hepatic, depending on whether the enzyme deficiency occurs in red blood cells or in the liver. Variegate porphyria is the most common form of porphyria in South Africa. It is characterized by skin hyperpigmentation and hypertrichosis, abdominal pain, tachycardia, hypertension and neuromuscular disturbances. High fecal levels of protoporphyrin and coproporphyrin, increased urine uroporphyrins and iron overload are typical markers of the disease.

This may lead to compensatory retinal neovascularization, which is thought to be induced by hypoxia from the initial avascular insult. New vessels are prone to leakage and rupture causing exudates and bleeding, followed by scarring, retinal detachment and blindness. Clinical features can be highly variable, even within the same family. Patients with mild forms of the disease are asymptomatic, and their only disease related abnormality is an arc of avascular retina in the extreme temporal periphery. In many ways the disease resembles retinopathy of prematurity but there is no evidence of prematurity or small birth weight in the patient history.

DI-03622	definition	An autoimmune condition of the eye that sequentially mimics uveitis, retinitis pigmentosa, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy as it progresses to complete blindness. Patients present during the second or third decade of life with posterior uveitis and reduction of the electroretinogram b-wave. They become more symptomatic when cataracts, cystoid macular edema, and disk edema diminish visual acuity during the second stage. Severe vision loss begins during the third stage when proliferative retinal neovascularization and epiretinal membranes appear. There is an ongoing pigmentary retinal degeneration and peripheral visual field loss during all stages. In the fourth stage, proliferative vitreoretinopathy causes tractional retinal detachments at the macula and vitreous base. The fifth or end-stage disease is marked by phthisis.

DI-01162	definition	An autosomal recessive pigmentary skin disorder characterized by solar hypersensitivity of the skin, high predisposition for developing cancers on areas exposed to sunlight and, in some cases, neurological abnormalities. XPV shows normal nucleotide excision repair, but an exaggerated delay in recovery of replicative DNA synthesis. Most patients with the variant type of xeroderma pigmentosum do not develop clinical symptoms and skin neoplasias until a later age. Clinical manifestations are limited to photo-induced deterioration of the skin and eyes.

DI-03641	canonical	Zinc deficiency, transient neonatal.
DI-03641	definition	A disorder occurring in breast-fed infants as a consequence of low milk zinc concentration in their nursing mothers, which cannot be corrected by maternal zinc supplementation. A large amount of zinc, an essential trace mineral, is required for normal growth particularly in infants, and breast milk normally contains adequate zinc to meet the requirement for infants up to 4 to 6 months of age. Zinc deficiency can lead to dermatitis, alopecia, decreased growth, and impaired immune function. The disorder shows autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance.
