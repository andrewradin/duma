This directory started as an evaluation of UniChem for matching drugs across
databases.  The script ../drugbank/match.py attempts to match all drugbank
drugs to chembl by various methods and extracts statistics.  The details are
below, but basically the best strategy is:
- first try matching by InChI
- for unmatched drugs, try matching by name
Lots of other resources were looked at, and none really added any value.

Further enhancements we should look at are:
- Aaron's structural distance idea
- sanity checking of results (to guard against database entry errors)

Some principles seem to be emerging:
- matching is important in several contexts:
  - building a combo drug collection
  - building a combo DPI file
  - assigning foreign DPI keys to drugs
  - preventing duplicate drug imports
- it's not clear whether this implies a tool used in all the contexts, or a
  tool used off-line to build a cross-reference which can be consulted in all
  these contexts (I suspect the latter)
- PLAT-526 might best be postponed waiting for this issue to be addressed
  (although it could be implemented based just on m_ keys in drug collections)
 
Some tools that might be useful are:
- ChEMBL has a full set of web APIs (see https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/ws);
  although we should access a local DB copy for production, they can be
  useful for seeing what data is available on a drug as we learn our way
  around the schema

Output is organized by source ids, listed here:
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/unichem/ucquery/listSources
Initially relevant are:
1 - chembl
2 - drugbank
22 - pubchem
31 - bindingdb

See the README file at the FTP URL for organization details.

- the Chemical Identity resolver shows lots of aliases for a given substance
  - 'pip install cirpy' to get a nice python interface

TODO:
- modify drugbank/matcher.py so that the ChEMBL name match happens in the
  upper portion, maybe replacing unichem, which doesn't seem to add much.
  - inchi
  - name

Compare drugbank w/ ChEMBL:
- latest drugbank extract contains 8198 drugs
- 3978 of them are linked to chembl in unichem
  - all but 5 of these can also be matched by inchi code
- 7086 of them have InChI codes
  - 3113 plus the 3973 above = 7086 matches to chembl
- of the 1107 that can't be matched by one of the above 2 methods:
  -  37 have both SMILES and DPI data
  - 483 have DPI but no SMILES
  -  24 have SMILES but no DPI
  - 124 more have external keys (mostly CAS) but no other data
  - 439 have no DPI, structural data, or external keys

So, 439 are basically nothing but a name, and are probably ok to drop.
(but as an example, DB05103 gets an inchi code back from CIR using the
canonical name, and that then matches to ChEMBL as CHEMBL100014; ChEMBL
had no target info either)

The 520 that have DPI may be more worth matching via something similar to
the above.  Of those:
- 315 have no external keys; in a test set of 20 I got zero hits in CIR on
  the canonical name
- 169 have only CAS keys; in a test set of 20 I got one hit in CIR on
  the canonical name; using CAS I got 3 hits
  - using ChemSpider manually, I was getting more like 50% (4 of 6), but
    this seems to have commercial restrictions on the API

Attempting name matches in ChEMBL turned up 441 hits out of the entire 1107
that weren't otherwise matched.  I don't know what the population of the
residual unmatched compounds looks like.
