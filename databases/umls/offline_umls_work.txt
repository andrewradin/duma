The UMLS program to parse the raw data was run on Aaron Daugherty's window's machine to
  extract the metathes data for specific vocabularies of interest.
Thus far these specific vocabularies have been extracted individually -
  resulting in their own set of files
For each set of files/vocabulary a large number of other files were generated,
  but the only data we needed for the UMLS to <vocab> conversion is the MRCONSO file.
So only that is put on S3, and named in the following manner:
MRCONSO.<vocab name>.RRF.gz

vocab names extracted so far:
meddra
icd9_icd10 (both ICD9 and ICD10 extracted together)

The MRSAB.RRF file (in extra files on Glacier),
 is the go to file for identifying what search term to use to search through MRCONSO
 (e.g. for meddra it was MDR18_1) if we want to convert other datasources to UMLS or vice versa
  NOTE this is only applicable if the entire metathesaraus is extracted
